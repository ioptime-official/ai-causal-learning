# Causal Learning Repository

Welcome to the Causal Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring causal inference using the [`do-why`](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy)  library, visualizing causal relationships through causal graphs, performing correlation analysis, and implementing explainable AI for decision-making.

## Overview

Causal learning is the process of understanding how variables in a system interact with each other and influence outcomes. In this repository, we utilize the following techniques:

1. **do-why Library**: The `do-why` library is used for causal inference, allowing us to estimate causal effects from observational data.

2. **Causal Graphs**: We create causal graphs to visually represent relationships between different variables and illustrate how they influence each other in a causal system.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: Correlation analysis is employed to explore relationships between variables and identify potential causal links.

4. **Explainable AI**: We implement explainable AI techniques to ensure that the decisions and actions taken by AI models are easily understood and interpreted by humans.

## Getting Started

To execute the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**: Use Conda to create a virtual environment with Python 3.10:
    ```
    conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.10
    ```

2. **Activate the Environment**: Activate the virtual environment:
    ```
    conda activate ENV_NAME
    ```

3. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: Install Jupyter Notebook within the virtual environment:
    ```
    pip install notebook
    ```

4. **Open VS Code**: Use the command `code .` to open the repository in Visual Studio Code.

5. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository, install any further dependencies if required, and execute the code.

For more detailed instructions and explanations, refer to the notebook files in this repository.

## Presentation

Additionally, a presentation is available in this repository to provide a brief overview and explanation of the concepts of causal learning.
